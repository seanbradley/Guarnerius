# Guarnerius
#### An app for finding and booking professional musicians--powered by Python; built on Angular.js and Mongo.


### ABOUT GUARNERIUS

This is a work in progress, a pre-beta release. You can see the site live at:

<http://concerttalent.com>

You must be a professional musician to register on the live site. If you're a developer and want access, e-mail the repo's maintainer. (See below.)

### TECHNOLOGY STACK
Guarnerius is built on Angular and Node, and installed on an AWS EC2 server (Ubuntu Precise 12.04-i386) associated with an Elastic IP. It is meant to serve as the client to the Talatat API built on Pyramid. Site styling is provided courtesy of Bootstrap.  All HTML5/CSS3 is fully validated. Right now, the live site is simply a Flask-powered landing page.

### HOW TO RUN
Right now, a shell script is included to launch a Node dev server in the main app directory. This should serve the Javascript files as required.
